# JookyTunes

A nice little standalone karaoke player based on React and Electron.

## Quickstart

Install all dependencies:

```
$ yarn
```

Launch the dev server:

```
$ yarn start
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser. You'll need to upload a pair of files: a CDG file for the graphics, and an MP3 file for the audio.

## Status

What's working:

* Audio and graphics playback
* A really basic playlist

Still TODO:

* Improve UI
* Add playlist controls: Play/pause, previous, next
* Persist playlist and data using `localStorage`
* Electron!
